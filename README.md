## ðŸ“„ About The Project
Built using the MERN stack. CraftACard provides a convenient way for users to create personalized electronic cards and share them with their friends and loved ones. _You can also use it to anonymously email anyone ðŸ¤«_.

<br/>

### ðŸš€ Features
- **Send custom e-card:** Users can send a custom e-card for any occasion to any email address.
- **Include Images:** Users can upload personal images to their e-card.
- **Generate Quotes or Video:** Users have the option to generate random images or quotes that they can attach to their ecard.
<br/>

### ðŸ’» Tech Used
I used this tech to develop the project:

- [**MongoDB:**](https://www.mongodb.com/) Used a NoSQL database to store user data as well as informatuon users include in their e-cards.
- [**Express.js:**](https://expressjs.com/) Used to handle server-side routing and API requests.
- [**React:**](https://react.dev/) Used to create the client-side of the application.
- [**Node.js:**](https://nodejs.org/en) Used to handle server-side logic and database operations.
- [**Axios:**](https://axios-http.com/) Used for making API requests to the server and external APIs.
- [**React Bootstrap:**](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) Used for a better user experience and responsive design.

<br/>

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
Developing this project gave me some solid hands-on experience building a full-stack application from start to finish. I decided to use a NoSQL database like MongoDB, simply because I wanted to learn more about it. Having never used a NoSQL database prior to this project, I faced a few challenges relating to how I should properly store user data and how to handle generated and uploaded images. After reading some docs and debugging I was able to successfully overcome these issues. This project provided me with a better understanding of the intricacies of full-stack development and taught me a lot about NoSQL databases.
